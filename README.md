# 🧾 FinTrack

[:brazil: Português](./Docs/PortugueseREADME.md)

FinTrack is a financial tracking application designed to help users manage budgets and expenses effectively. This project includes a backend built with ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL, all containerized using Docker.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular PostgreSQL database with schema separation (`income`, `expense`)
- Dockerized local environment setup
- ASP.NET Core Web API

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (comes with Docker Desktop)
- [.NET SDK 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) *(to run the API outside the container)*
- Terminal with support to `bash` (`WSL`, Git Bash on Windows or terminal Linux/macOS)

---

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

> All the setup is automated using `setup.sh`.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FinTrack.git
cd FinTrack
```

### 2. Run Setup
```bash
sh setup.sh
```

This script will:

- Spin up the PostgreSQL and API containers
- Wait for PostgreSQL to become ready
- Create the fintrack database if it doesn't exist
- Create the required schemas: income, expense

### 3. Enjoy FinTrack
```bash
✅ Everything is ready! Go to: http://localhost:7019/
```
